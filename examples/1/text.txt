A 62-year-old male with a well-documented 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension presented to our emergency department with the acute onset of severe, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. The nature and distribution of the pain were entirely consistent with the classical features of acute myocardial infarction, including its intensity, radiation, and lack of response to rest. What made this case particularly alarming was the presence of multiple compounding cardiovascular risk factors, including a 30-pack-year smoking history and a known diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. These conditions, long recognized as major contributors to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, significantly heightened the index of suspicion for an ongoing acute coronary event. On initial presentation, vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 178/94 mmHg and a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, suggestive of hypertensive urgency and heightened sympathetic activity. Physical examination revealed diaphoresis, pallor, and a new S4 gallop on cardiac auscultation, all clinical markers raising concern for myocardial ischemia and early left ventricular dysfunction. An immediate 12-lead ECG demonstrated 3 mm ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal depressions in anterior leads, a classic pattern indicating inferior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Laboratory analysis showed an elevated troponin I concentration of 8.7 ng/mL, with a dynamic rise and fall pattern typical for acute myocardial injury. Based on the patient's hemodynamic status, electrocardiographic findings, and high-risk comorbid profile, an expedited coronary angiography was performed within 45 minutes of arrival. The procedure revealed a critical 95% occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery with evidence of a superimposed thrombus and disrupted atherosclerotic plaque morphology. Percutaneous coronary intervention was promptly performed, and two drug-eluting stents were successfully deployed, restoring TIMI grade 3 flow. Post-intervention management included initiation of high-intensity statin therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, and comprehensive pharmacologic therapy targeting neurohormonal modulation for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These therapies were selected in accordance with the current standard of care aimed at minimizing recurrent ischemic events and optimizing long-term myocardial recovery. The patient's post-procedural course was complicated by transient complete heart block, a known consequence of inferior myocardial infarctions involving the conduction system. Temporary pacing support was required for stabilization, with spontaneous resolution occurring within 48 hours. Following stabilization, the patient was enrolled in a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program with a focus on early mobilization, lifestyle modification, glycemic control, and blood pressure management. At six-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in exercise tolerance and quality of life. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from 35% to 48%, consistent with partial myocardial recovery and effective remodeling. This case underscores the critical importance of early recognition and timely intervention in acute coronary syndromes, particularly in patients with complex metabolic and vascular comorbidities. It also reflects the growing need for integrated, patient-centered management strategies in contemporary cardiovascular care.
