RESULTS:
A 62-year-old male with a well-documented 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension presented to our emergency department with the acute onset of severe, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm and jaw. The nature and distribution of the pain were entirely consistent with the classical features of acute myocardial infarction, including its intensity, radiation, and lack of response to rest.

CONCLUSIONS:
This case underscores the critical importance of early recognition and timely intervention in acute coronary syndromes, particularly in patients with complex metabolic and vascular comorbidities. It also reflects the growing need for integrated, patient-centered management strategies in contemporary cardiovascular care.
